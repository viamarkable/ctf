During an archaeological dig, you uncover an ancient scroll of scrambled text with an aquila at the end of the message. 

Your task is to decrypt the message and find the hidden flag. 
The only clue you have is the word "peace", written in plaintext above the encrypted message... but that seems to have been written much, much later than the original scroll...
