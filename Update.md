Hello and welcome again to my CTF compilation! If you've gotten here, I assume that you're poking around (I would be too) and have landed on this page.

Here's just a quick place for me to place progress updates at the more major checkpoints, so that users have more information as to what is happening aside from the very basic, and likely neglected README.md >_<

V1: First release, August 7th 2024
Currently, I have 11 CTF puzzles created (5 easy, 3 medium, 3 hard) and I've decided to put a pause to making puzzles so far. I have started writing the cipher code to solve them, using user input to plug into the algorithm. Only the caeserCipher.java file has been completed so far, and I'm working off that baseline for the vigenereCipher.java file, which is a big work in progress. There's not too much to tinker around with right now due to the lack of coding done so far, but there are puzzles with detailed writeups uploaded. Have fun playing! (25 hours)
