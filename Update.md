Hello and welcome again to my CTF compilation! If you've gotten here, I assume that you're poking around (I would be too) and have landed on this page.

Here's just a quick place for me to place progress updates at the more major checkpoints, so that users have more information as to what is happening aside from the very basic, and likely neglected README.md >_<

V2.5: Arcade release, August 31st 2024
HC's Arcade is ending :(, but scripts are now all in Java, Python, and C++, with some in other variants! The new folder of cipher-codes hosts tons of scripts in various languages that do not yet have a CTF puzzle to go with, but I wanted to code them just for fun. This is only a release V2.5 because not all the scripts have been tested yet to check their quality, and there are fine tuning opportunities in each script that will be completed later down the line. More to come!

V2: Second release, August 29th 2024
The amount of CTF puzzles have remained the same, but I've added many more solving scripts for each puzzle. There are scripts in both Java and Python, and I'm looking to expand to more C languages soon. However, some of the scripts have been denoted as not functional as there are small bugs that I still need to fix.

V1: First release, August 7th 2024
Currently, I have 11 CTF puzzles created (5 easy, 3 medium, 3 hard) and I've decided to put a pause to making puzzles so far. I have started writing the cipher code to solve them, using user input to plug into the algorithm. Only the caeserCipher.java file has been completed so far, and I'm working off that baseline for the vigenereCipher.java file, which is a big work in progress. There's not too much to tinker around with right now due to the lack of coding done so far, but there are puzzles with detailed writeups uploaded. Have fun playing! (25 hours)
